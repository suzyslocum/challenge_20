# Automate the Creation of Joint Savings Accounts with Solidity Smart Contracts

*Module 20 Challenge Assignment *

---

## Overview 
---
  We have created a Solidity smart contract that automates the creation of joint savings accounts. The smart contract accepts two user addresses that can then control a joint savings account. It uses ether management functions to implement a financial institution's requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features include the ability to deposit and withdraw funds, as well as the ability to check the account balance, view which account was the last to make a withdrawal, and view the last withdrawal amount.

## Usage

To run this program, clone the repository onto your computer, navigate to its source folder in your terminal and open the "joint_savings.sol" file in the Remix IDE at [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js) to view and interact with the smart contract.
